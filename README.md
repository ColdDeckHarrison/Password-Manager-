# Password-Manager-

First of all, Thank you for having a look at my Password Manager. 
I Have done extensive external testing to ensure that no issues occur when running this application. However, If you see any issues with the application OR you see a way to make the application better, please feel free to request changes to the code. 

This project was a combination of a number of projects that I completed while using a bootcamps curriculum while being a self taught programmer. 
I had initially build a random password generator. An easy enough project that randomly pickes 8-10 letters, 2-4 symbols and 2-4 numbers from precreated arrays. 
The number of items chosen from each group as well as the types of symbols can all be adjusted to create even more robust passwords depending on the needs of the user. 

The remainder of the program is a simple TKinter import that has been written to include text boxes for the website, username and the password used for that specific account. The website space is used to save where the account is being made. It can be as complex as an entire URL or as simple as the name "Facebook".

The email/username text box can be set to preload the email address most likely to be used for the account. I have removed this portion as it is again, up to the needs of the user. Finally, the password can be self created OR the generate password button can be clicked and a passwords with the above mentioned specs will be created and saved so that you only need to paste it onto the website. 

When add is clicked the template will clear, if everything was input correctly and will be saved as a JSON file. If no file previsously exists than a new one will be made. The search click box is used if you are looking for a specific account and you cannot recall whether or not an account has already been created or if you need to find the email and passwords used for that specific account.

If you are a seasoned programmer and/or you are strong in creating .exe files. You should feel free to create this as an independent program that does not require the owner to have python loaded onto their computer. I have been, so far, unable to create a working version independent of my IDE.
